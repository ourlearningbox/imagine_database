## DA database arquitecture

```
mORMot+FPC+Lazarus:
First, a server is made. With an embedded sqlite3 engine. Testing: Windows; running: Linux.
Followed by a windows/linux client app. With local and remote (the server) database (single change: 2 lines of code).
The above allows for very easy testing and GUI.
Followed by an Android app with LAMW with local database for easy testing. Followed by the remote database connection.
Database logic is shared between all clients and the server(s).
As an extra, Javascript clients (JSON, remote server) allow for many more clients.
